<p>This project was based on the Qt oscilloscope <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtcharts-qmloscilloscope-example.html">example</a>, but a slightly different version (much older, I guess) which is available <a href="https://github.com/ex/qwt">here</a>. Starting with that template, I gradually added new functionalities. These included a ‘Stop’ button, a ‘Change Color’ button to modify the curve color, a checkbox labeled ‘Legend’ to display amplitude and frequency within the plot, a wheel for vertical displacement of the curve, and a ‘Foto actual’ button to take a screenshot and capture the current state of the plot. All of these features were integrated into a new window layout. Additionally, the project allows exporting the screenshot through a ‘Save image’ button. This project was part of a programming exam, and I decided to put it here because it was interesting to play with UI programming and the Qt library for the first time. Everything was made with C++ and Qt 5 (If it sounds old to you, the self-containing template came with that version). Despite using an older version, I learned and experimented from the Qt 6 documentation.</p>

<p>I implemented ray tracing entirely on a GPU based on Whitted’s algorithm, with the goal of rendering fully ray-traced scenes in real-time settings through a user interface. This project served as my undergraduate thesis. The implementation covers ray tracing for perfect light reflection and refraction, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~deb39/Classes/Papers/p343-whitted.pdf">original paper</a>. The algorithm is capable of reproducing light effects such as mirror reflection and diffuse reflection. Additionally, I implemented five Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials using a design pattern based on the <a href="https://pbrt.org/">PBRT book</a>. The implementation also includes linear transformations, scene loading, and real-time configuration. Users can explore and experiment with scenes, adjusting settings such as the number of bounces, light, and camera position.</p>

<p>A Cornell Box made entirely with GLSL (The OpenGL Shading Language) using the raymarching algorithm, specifically, the sphere tracing technique. The Cornell Box is a scene used for testing the quality of renderers, now it is also part of the graphics lore. This is a Glossy-recreated Cornell Box rendered entirely with raymarching. The surfaces are assumed to be glossy (perfectly reflective like a mirror) and the reflections are set up for 2 ray bounces by default. Also, the bounces can be modified in the code but be aware that more bounces mean less perfomance (fps). I wanted to create this with the objective of imitating the effects that a regular raytracing does but with raymarching. Currently, the program runs in realtime (&gt;30fps) in a 800x450 resolution, try going fullscreen <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/DdfSWB">here</a>!.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: This is not how a rendering algorithm should work, specially offline renderers that use ray tracing/path tracing but this was a fun project to do and I guess there still exists room for more optimization.</p>
